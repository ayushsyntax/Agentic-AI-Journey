        "Artificial intelligence has been evolving fast. For years, generative models like ChatGPT have dazzled us by creating text, images, or code on demand. But there’s a new phase emerging in AI research and development that *doesn’t just wait for instructions* — it *acts on them*. This is **Agentic AI**, a paradigm built around autonomous systems capable of planning, reasoning, and executing multistep tasks with minimal human oversight. ([Exabeam][1])\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, Agentic AI pushes the boundary from reactive assistance toward **proactive agency**. Rather than responding to each prompt you give it, an agentic system interprets a high-level objective, decomposes it into actionable parts, interacts with tools and systems, adapts to feedback, and delivers results — much like a digital team member.

        "\n",
        "To qualify as truly agentic, a system typically exhibits these capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Autonomy**: Makes decisions and chooses how to act without being micromanaged.\n",
        "**Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Maintains a persistent objective that guides every action.\n",
        "**Planning Ability**: Breaks high-level goals into sequences of actionable steps.\n",
        "**Reasoning**: Evaluates options, learns from feedback, and adjusts strategy.\n",
        "**Adaptability**: Alters plans when conditions change or tools fail.\n",
        "**Context Awareness**: Keeps track of past interactions and user preferences to inform current decisions. ([Exabeam][1])\n",
        "\n",

        "### **How Autonomy Is Controlled in Practice**\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its promise, autonomy comes with risk. Unsupervised decision-making by software can lead to unintended actions — from costly mistakes to privacy breaches. To guard against this, most agentic systems incorporate:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints:** Critical decisions require explicit approval before execution.\n",
        "* **Guardrails and Policies:** Hard limits on behavior (e.g., no weekend scheduling).\n",
        "* **Override Controls:** Users can pause, redirect, or halt the system at any time. ([University of Cincinnati][3])\n",

This paradigm shift transforms AI from a tool that responds to explicit instructions into an intelligent partner that independently pursues high-level objectives with minimal human intervention.\n",

        "- **Generative AI (Reactive Paradigm):** Traditional systems like standard chatbots operate on a prompt-response cycle, requiring manual step-by-step guidance for complex tasks. For example, hiring a back-end engineer would necessitate separate prompts for job description creation, interview question generation, and candidate screening.\n",
        "- **Agentic AI (Proactive Paradigm):** Users define the end goal—\"Hire a back-end engineer\"—and the autonomous agent orchestrates the entire workflow: drafting job descriptions, posting to job boards via APIs, filtering applications, conducting initial screenings, and scheduling interviews without continuous human direction .\n",

        "| **2. Goal-Oriented** | Persistent objective maintenance in core memory, directing all actions toward the outcome rather than isolated prompt responses | The hiring agent maintains the \"hire qualified engineer\" goal throughout weeks of candidate interactions |\n",
        "| **3. Planning** | Breaking high-level goals into structured sub-tasks, generating multiple candidate plans, evaluating efficiency/cost, and selecting optimal paths  | The agent creates three different hiring strategies (internal referral vs. job boards vs. recruiters) and selects the most cost-effective option |\n",
        "| **4. Reasoning** | Cognitive interpretation of environmental feedback, drawing conclusions, and adaptive decision-making during planning and execution | When interview no-shows increase, the agent reasons that confirmation reminders are needed and implements them |\n",
        "| **5. Adaptability** | Strategy modification in response to unexpected conditions while maintaining goal alignment  | If a job board API fails, the agent switches to alternative platforms without abandoning the hiring objective |\n",
        "| **6. Context Awareness** | Retention and utilization of information from past interactions, user preferences, and environmental cues through multi-step processes | The agent remembers that technical interviews for this team always include algorithm challenges and ensures candidates are prepared |\n",
