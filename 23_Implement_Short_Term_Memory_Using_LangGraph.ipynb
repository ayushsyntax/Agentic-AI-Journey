        "Short-Term Memory in LangGraph stores the *current conversation history* (messages, state) so your AI agent remembers what happened earlier in the *same session*. This data is tied to a **thread ID** so the agent can resume where it left off if needed, even across restarts. LangGraph manages this as **state inside the graph**, and you persist it with a **checkpointer**. ([LangChain Docs][1])\n",

        "A: The current conversation thread: messages, summaries, and any state variables needed to produce the next response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How is STM keyed?\n",
        "A: By `thread_id`. Without a stable thread identifier, there is no memory continuity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why does a server restart wipe memory when using default settings?\n",
        "A: Because `MemorySaver` keeps state in process memory only; it has no persistence layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What happens when you switch to `PostgresSaver`?\n",
        "A: State becomes durable. After restart, passing the same `thread_id` reconstructs the thread and resumes seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why worry about context size?\n",
        "A: Large histories quickly exceed LLM context windows, inflate cost, and induce failure modes (timeouts, hallucinations, truncation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why trimming instead of summarizing?\n",
        "A: Trimming is trivial to implement and fast. It retains recency but discards older context.\n",

        "Q: Why summarizing instead of trimming?\n",
        "A: Summarization preserves informational continuity: details from previous turns survive as compressed content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why explicit deletion?\n",
        "A: STM state is cumulative unless pruned. Without deletion operators like `RemoveMessage`, the underlying state will grow indefinitely—even if older content is ignored during LLM calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Is summarization the same as long-term memory?\n",
