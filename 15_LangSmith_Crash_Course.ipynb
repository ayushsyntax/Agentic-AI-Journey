        "**Q1. Why do LLM applications need observability at all?**\n",
        "Because LLM systems are probabilistic, multi-step, cost-bearing, non-deterministic pipelines. Traditional logs tell you what happened; observability tells you why. That distinction matters when a workflow jumps from 2 → 10 minutes or ₹0.50 → ₹2.00 per run with no code change.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. Why do Runs matter in debugging RAG hallucinations?**\n",
        "Because hallucinations come in two flavors:\n",
        "• retriever failure (bad docs)\n",
        "• generator failure (bad reasoning)\n",
        "\n",
        "Runs let you inspect intermediate artifacts: query vectors, retrieved chunks, combined prompt, and final output. Without that, you’re stuck shrugging at the ceiling.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4. Why does LangSmith help with cost and token explosions?**\n",
        "Because it logs input/output token counts per run, aggregates across traces, and ties it to model pricing. The “perfectionist loop” pathology in agents becomes visible instead of silently incinerating money.\n",
