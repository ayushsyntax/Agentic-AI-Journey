        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Because multiple nodes execute concurrently. Returning the full state would cause conflicting writes for keys that were not actually modified. Partial updates ensure deterministic merges.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. What happens if two parallel nodes update the same key without a reducer?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "LangGraph raises a conflict error and halts execution. Concurrent writes to the same key require an explicit reducer to define merge semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. Why is `operator.add` commonly used as a reducer?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "It provides deterministic, associative merging for lists or numeric accumulations. This makes it ideal for collecting scores, messages, or logs from parallel nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. Can parallel nodes depend on each other’s outputs?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "No. Any dependency introduces an execution order, which violates parallel execution. Dependent logic must be placed downstream in a fan-in node.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q5. How does LangGraph achieve parallelism without explicit async code?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Parallelism is derived from graph topology. Nodes with no interdependencies and the same upstream edge are executed concurrently by the runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q6. Why are structured outputs critical in parallel LLM workflows?\n",

        "They enforce type safety and bounded values, preventing malformed outputs from corrupting shared state during merges.\n",
